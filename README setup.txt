The Task1.scm program:

Requires:
  Any software capable of running Scheme files.
  The university standard is DrRacket (free online).

  Inside Dr.Racket it can be run (while open) with
  ctrl + r.

  I chose this since the task last year was in closjure,
  scheme being another dialect of the lisp group.

The WikiFriend.py program:

Requires:
  Wit.ai support
  Wikipedia API support

Wit.ai
  Installing wit using the terminal should suffice.
  Like this:
  > pip install wit

  Worked on my computer (Windows 10)

Wikipedia API
  Installing wit using the terminal should suffice.
  Like this:
  > pip install wikipedia

  (again, worked at my end)

Python
  as it is a python program, it needs to be run through python.
  Should be as easy as:
  > python WikiFriend.py

Exiting the program:
  Telling the WikiFriend "goodbye", will make it print a
  short goodbye message, before terminating itself.

If any other errors appeared, please contact me.

NB:
If you please, enter the code and change the value of debug to True, so that you
will get the Wit.ai response.
