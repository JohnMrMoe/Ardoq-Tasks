The WikiFriend.py program:

Requires:
  Wit.ai support
  Wikipedia API support

Wit.ai
  Installing wit using the terminal should suffice.
  Like this:
  > pip install wit

  Worked on my computer (Windows 10)

Wikipedia API
  Installing wit using the terminal should suffice.
  Like this:
  > pip install wikipedia

  (again, worked at my end)

Python
  as it is a python program, it needs to be run through python.
  Should be as easy as:
  > python WikiFriend.py

If any other errors appeared, please contact me.

NB:
If you please, enter the code and change the value of debug to True, so that you
will get the Wit.ai response.
