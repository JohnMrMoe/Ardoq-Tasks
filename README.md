# Ardoq-Tasks
For review

Hello, I presume this is the first file you will read when you open the project. As
such I add some oversight over the remainder of the project here:
  
  1. The Ardoq assigment included two tasks. In this submission one can find
  
     the answers to task 1, and task 2c.
  
  2. Task 1 can be found in the Task1.scm file.
  
     All fascets with this file are commented on in the "README setup.txt"
     
     file.
     
  3. Task 2c can be found in the WikiFriend.py file.
  
       i.  Setup and requirements are handled in the "README setup.txt" file.
       
      ii.  My choice of bot API is adressed in the
      
           "README witai and implementation.txt" file
           
     iii.  A short runover of the implementation can be found in the
     
           "README witai and implementation.txt" file
           
      iv.  Finally, a run down of the criterias from Task 2c,
      
           including here a conversation between yours truly and the WikiFriend
           
           can be found in the "REDME-- WikiFriend -.txt" file.
           
Thank you for checking this out.
