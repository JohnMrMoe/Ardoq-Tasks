Criteria 1: The chatbout should include at least 2 commands
  Well, it sort of has several:
    1. Explain
    2. Search
    3. User
    4. Responses
      i. confirm
      ii. deny
    4. Miscellaneous others...
      i. greeting
      ii. goodbye



      ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Criteria 2: One of the commands should give a follow-up question.
  The command 'explain'* extracts your search words, and finds
  the wikipedia page for it (or, the redirected one if that fails (or
  a polite "error" if nothing is found)). It will print the summary of the page,
  before asking the user if they would like to read further.

  The user can then respond in method that would trigger the 'confirm'** command.
  This will *attempt* to print out the two next sections, separated by '=', '==',
  or '===' signs.

  If the user responds with anything that would fit under deny, the bot will
  clear the page it has open currently.
    This is superfluous, as a new search will overwrite the old one.
    It is made even more superfluous by the fact that the prompt is always open
    to all commands, meaning that one doesn't actually have to respond to the inquiry.

  *Can be prompted with sentences like: "tell me about X", "what do you know about X", etc.
  **Can be prompted with triggers like "yes", "continue", "go on"


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Criteria 3: One of the commands should give an answer from a public API (i.e. Yr,
    Coindesk, The Internet Chuck Norris Database, ...)

  I elected the Wikipedia API, both search and explain use both this api, and the wit.ai api.

20.   "IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) is an American multinational technology company
    headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company
    originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed "International
    Business Machines" in 1924.
      IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and
    consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major
    research organization, holding the record for most U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2018)
    for 25 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the
    floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming
    language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by
    the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.
      IBM has continually shifted its business mix by commoditizing markets focusing on higher-value, more
    profitable markets. This includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and selling off its
    personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (2005 and 2014,
    respectively), and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), and The Weather
    Company (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go "fabless", continuing to design semiconductors,
    but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries.
      Nicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the
    world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as "IBMers", IBM employees have
    been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology and five National
    Medals of Science."

23. " History

    In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM).
    Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman
    Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's
    arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in
    New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)
    based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton,
    New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto. They manufactured machinery for sale and
    lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and
    punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called
    on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR. Watson joined CTR as General Manager then, 11 months later, was made President
    when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices,
    Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies. He implemented sales conventions, "generous sales
    incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical
    fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker". His favorite slogan, "THINK", became a mantra for
    each company's employees. During Watson's first four years, revenues reached $9 million and the company's operations
    expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR"
    and on February 14, 1924 chose to replace it with the more expansive title "International Business Machines". By 1933
    most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.

    In 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including
    the U.S. Government, during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the
    Social Security Act, and Hitler's Third Reich, largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag.
    In 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.
    In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son Thomas Watson, Jr. was named president.
    In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's
    Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience.
    In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system
    for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers
    helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from
    New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration,
    participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.

    On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of
    commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models
    with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370
    in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing
    platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on
    them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor,
    had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their
    marketshare.
    In 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code. IBM and the World Bank first introduced
    financial swaps to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement. The IBM PC, originally designated IBM
    5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991, IBM sold printer manufacturer Lexmark.
    In 1993, IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history. Lou Gerstner was hired
    as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around. In 2002, IBM acquired PwC consulting, and in 2003 it initiated a
    project to redefine company values, hosting a three-day online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees.
    The result was three values: "Dedication to every client's success", "Innovation that matters—for our company and for
    the world", and "Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships".

    In 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo and, in 2009, it
    acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National
    Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its
    artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on Jeopardy! where it won against game-show champions
    Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary on the same year on June 16.
    In 2012, IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa, and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a
    web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.
    In 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for $2.1 billion. Also that year, IBM
    began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc., Twitter, Facebook,
    Tencent, Cisco, UnderArmour, Box, Microsoft, VMware, CSC, Macy's, Sesame Workshop, the parent company of Sesame
    Street, and Salesforce.com.
    In 2015, IBM announced two major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion and all digital assets from The
    Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app. Also that year, IBMers created the
    film A Boy and His Atom, which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video
    conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit. In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in
    quarterly sales. The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after
    IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit."

41. "A riverboat casino is a type of casino on a riverboat found in several states in the United
    States with frontage on the Mississippi River and its tributaries, or along the Gulf Coast.
    Several states authorized this type of casino in order to enable gaming but limit the areas
    where casinos could be constructed; it was a type of legal fiction as the riverboats were
    seldom if ever taken away from the dock.

43. > Indeed
44. " History
    Paddlewheel riverboats had long been used on the Mississippi River and its tributaries to
    transport passengers and freight. After railroads largely superseded them, in the 20th century,
    they were more frequently used for entertainment excursions, sometimes for several hours, than
    for passage among riverfront towns. They were often a way for people to escape the heat of the
    town, as well as to enjoy live music and dancing. Gambling was also common on the riverboats,
    in card games and via slot machines.
    When riverboat casinos were first approved in the late 20th century by the states, which generally
    prohibited gaming on land, these casinos were required to be located on ships that could sail away
    from the dock. In some areas, gambling was allowed only when the ship was sailing, as in the
    traditional excursions. They were approved in states with frontage along the Mississippi and its
    tributaries, including Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri.
    As an example, in 1994 Missouri voters approved amending the state constitution to allow "games of
    chance" on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. By 1998, "according to the state Gaming Commission,
    just three of the 16 operations comprising Missouri's $652-million riverboat gambling industry [were]
    clearly on the main river channel." The state supreme court had ruled that boats had to be "solely
    over and in contact with the surface" of the rivers. Several casinos had been located on riverboats
    located in a moat or an area with water adjacent to a navigable waterway, leading them to be referred
    to as "boats in moats." The state legislatures were unwilling to give up the revenues generated by
    gambling. Over time, they allowed gaming casinos to be built on stilts but they still had to be over
    navigable water.
    Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which destroyed most riverboat casinos and their associated
    facilities of hotels, restaurants, etc. in states along the Gulf Coast, several states changed
    their enabling legislation or amended constitutions. They permitted such casinos to be built on
    land within certain geographic limits from a navigable waterway. Most of Mississippi's Gulf Coast
    riverboat casinos have been rebuilt since the hurricane.
